This module is to allow Odoo to be used similar to a google Drive. It allows files to be attached to
objects in the odoo database.

It basically interprets objects as files or directories and files as attachments depending on the setting.

This is similar to earlier versions of OpenERP that had this feature. This is a
FUSE (User Space File System) which means the odoo directory can be mounted below any directory
and allows any file to be attached to any object. This must be defined in the database.

Each object can be defined as a file or a directory.

Eg.

Partners/{partner_name} - Would attach the files or list the files attached to the directory below this
directory.

Directory Node - Can be any object and can use any of the object fields as the directory names.
File Node - Can be any object and can use any report for as the object contents (file generated
as reports will be read only)

Note: Possibility to produce CSV or XML files that allow you to edit the object in database use file
manupulation tools.
